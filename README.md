# USB-oveer-IP
Reason for writing a program like this myself:
I have control over what the code does and alternetives are mostly not free or are to old and do not work properly anymore.

This concept is commenly used in combination with streaming but i wanted this specific function without streaming trough for example sunshine/moonlight.

This program is written to connect usb devices from the server with the client over my lan connection.
This is nice because now i dont need usb extensioncables. 
I can just put a raspberri in the place i want to connect a device and it will work.
The program is written in python because i dont know how to use other programming languages.
I'm not a progammer, i'm a network engineerder and studying to become a cybersecurity specialist.

I'm still modifying this code to fit my needs.
