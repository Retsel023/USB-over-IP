# USB-oveer-IP
This program is written to connect usb devices from the server with the client over my lan connection.
This is nice because now i dont need usb extensioncables. 
I can just put a raspberri in the place i want to connect a device and it will work.
The program is written in python because i dont know how to use other programming languages.
I'm not a progammer, i'm a network engineerder and studying to become a cybersecurity specialist.
